# Forkify

Forkify is a food recipe app that allows you to search over 100 000 recipes, and store your own! This project was one of the most advanced sections in the course with Jonas Schmedtmann. I learned how to store information with pure JS, fetching data from a database, but also storing it in the local storage, and how to use most of the ES5- and ES6 features I learned so far. <a href="https://martinfjeld.github.io/Forkify/">You can check it out here!</a>
